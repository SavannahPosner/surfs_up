#### **Overview of the statistical analysis:**
•	This statistical analysis compares the average temperatures of June and December for the viewer to determine if their ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. The goal is to retrieve summary statistics enabling the viewer to have a reasonable understanding of the expected temperatures. In addition to the requirements, this **program includes a  “RaceCar” function**, allowing the viewer to observe any chosen month and then view a statistical summary. 

#### **Key Differences in Weather between June and December:**

•	The **average temperature** for December is roughly four degrees **lower** than that of June. 

•	The **minimum temperature** for December is eight degrees **lower** than that of June.


•	The **maximum temperature** for December is two degrees **lower** than that of June. 

#### **Summary**:
* The mean, and quartile statistics don’t differ much. The greatest difference in temperature lies at the minimum, which differs only eight degrees. Outside of that, the standard deviation is noticeably higher at 3.76 for December when it is only 3.26 in June, potentially leading December to be a less reliable month, but it is still reasonable to believe that it a sustainable month for an ice cream business. 

* In addition to a temperature query, a precipitation query based on date would aid in determining the sustainability of the ice cream store during the year. Another thought pertains to a precipitation query based on location could illuminate the dry areas of the island and consequently potentially show the more profitable regions.
